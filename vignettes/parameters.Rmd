The parameter table below summarises the current best estimates incorporated in `squire`. These will be updated when new information becomes available. 

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Reference** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic reproductive number, R0 | 3.0 | [Report 13](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-13-europe-npi-impact/) |
| Mean Incubation Period | 4.6 days | [Report 9](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-9-impact-of-npis-on-covid-19/); [Linton et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/28/2020.01.26.20018754.full.pdf); [Li et al.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316) The last 0.5 days are included in the I_MILD and I_CASE states to capture pre-symptomatic infectivity |
| Generation Time | 6.75 days | [Report 9](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-9-impact-of-npis-on-covid-19/) |
| Mean Duration in I\_MILD | 2.1 days | Incorporates 0.5 days of infectiousness prior to symptoms; with parameters below ~95% of all infections are mild. In combination with mean duration in I\_CASE this gives a mean generation time as above |
| Mean Duration in I\_CASE | 4.5 days | Mean onset-to-admission of 4 days from UK data. Includes 0.5 days of infectiousness prior to symptom onset |
| Mean Duration of Hospitalisation for non-critical Cases (I\_HOSP) if survive | 9.5 days | Based on unpublished UK data |
| Mean Duration of Hospitalisation for non-critical Cases (I\_HOSP) if die | 7.6 days | Based on unpublished UK data |
| Mean duration of Critical Care (I\_ICU) if survive | 11.3 days | Based on [UK data](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) adjusted for censoring |
| Mean duration of Critical Care (I\_ICU) if die | 10.1 days | Based on [UK data](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) |
| Mean duration of Stepdown post ICU (I\_Rec) | 3.4 days | Based on unpublished UK data |
| Mean duration of hospitalisation if require ICU but do not receive it | 1 day | Working assumption |
| Probability of dying in critical care | 50% | Based on [UK data](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) |
| Probability of death if require critical care but do not receive it | 95% | Working assumption based on expert clinical opinion |
| Probability of death if require hospitalisation but do not receive it | 60% | Working assumption based on expert clinical opinion |
| Multiplier of duration of stay for LIC and LMIC settings compared to HIC | 50% | Working assumption based on expert clinical opinion |

### Age-Specific Parameters
